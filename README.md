This website was created by Ysabel Dela Cruz, Ron-Arvil Villar, and Gerald Rongcales for their capstone entitled "College Website with Discussion Forum and Document Request System" as part of requirements for the courses Capstone Project 1 and 2. With the objective of generating a centralized website that caters all the concerns, inquiries, news, and announcements in CCIS community, the developers built this system from April 2020 to January 2021.
This project aimed to motivate collective and cooperative work from all constituents of the college. While the administration is given a greater responsibility in managing the whole system, student organizations could contribute by writing content such as news articles and announcements. Students, alumni, and the faculty will also be encouraged to do their part by sharing their thoughts and answers in the discussion forum.
